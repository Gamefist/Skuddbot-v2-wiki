# Free for All
## Introduction
Free for All is a minigame where multiple users can battle, but only one will emerge victorious!

## Game flow
### Starting a game
A game is started with the `!freeforall` command. The user starting the game will be the host of the game.
A new game will be created and is put into what is known as the "outstanding" phase. There can only be one outstanding game per server.
{% hint style="info" %}
The [command](#command) section contains more details about the command.

### Entering the game
When a game is outstanding, a user can enter the game in 2 ways, without a bet or with a bet. Entering without a bet may be done by clicking the ![](https://i.imgur.com/o8SZQlF.png) reaction. When the user wants to enter with their default bet as bet they click the ![](https://i.imgur.com/LqZbyj6.png) reaction. When a user wants to bet a different amount they use the command: `!freeforall <bet>`
