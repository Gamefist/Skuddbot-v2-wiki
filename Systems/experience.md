# Experience
## Introduction
Skuddbot features an experience system. Uses can gain experience and level up. 

## Gaining experience
### Minigames
Users can play minigames in Skuddbot which will allow them to gain experience. The amount a user will gain is based on the minigame and the performacne of the user.
Currently the following minigames award experience:
* [Blackjack](/Minigames/blackjack.md)
* [Challenge](/Minigames/challenge.md)

### Chatting
A user will gain a random amount of experience between a set minimum and maximum value per message they post. These minimum and maximum values can be set by the server admins using the `!serversettings` command.
