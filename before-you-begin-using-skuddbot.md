### The current state of the bot <a id="h.bhlyxbncfxy6"></a>

Skuddbot is currently in alpha, or rather ‘very-early-probably-wont-work-alpha’ \(as I prefer to call it\). This alpha is also a CLOSED alpha, which means, you’ll need to get invited to it.

#### What “Alpha” means <a id="h.1cemssz8x3jm"></a>

Alpha means to me that the bot is in a “working” state but not optimized, and it might also be buggy, and also that I’m still adding features to the bot that are not finished.

Due to the fact it’s Alpha I do reserve a few rights to myself:  
I reserve the right to...

* To reset the database at any time I deem it necessary, but I will do my absolute fucking best to prevent that from having to happen EVER.
* To have Skuddbot leave your server, for several reasons.

#### Bugfixes/Updates during Alpha <a id="h.w9bu13o46v29"></a>

When a bug gets reported I will patch it as soon as I can, updates will happen as we go along, when I deem an update ready, I’ll deploy it onto the server.

### Enabling Developer Mode in Discord <a id="h.fugmz8n9b3yr"></a>

Whilst this is a completely optional thing, it might be wise thing to do. Now, I know, “Developer Mode” sounds a bit scary. But it isn’t.  
To enable it: Go to Discord, User Settings, Appearance, and tick the box with “Developer Mode” next to it.

Now you’ve done that, you can copy the ID of about everything, by just right clicking it and selecting “Copy ID”!
