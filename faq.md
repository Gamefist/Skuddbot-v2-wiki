### Will Skuddbot cost me anything? <a id="h.ao2y32uwev0q"></a>

Nope, Skuddbot’s core functionality will always be free, I might later on put in some paid features \(think of having a Music Bot\), but one advantage of being a Alpha tester is that you’ll get those for free when those come along. If you’d like to donate, you can, but it’s not required. There are some cool perks you will be able to earn from donating though \(as a thank you\). More information on that can be obtained by PM’ing me on Discord aswell as the donation link if you wish. AGAIN: NOT REQUIRED

### I have a feature request for Skuddbot, can you make it? <a id="h.tk35dqxbt3hv"></a>

### Will Skuddbot be available on \[insert platform here\]? <a id="h.bf5vfsyi49rl"></a>

Implementing a new platform takes time and requires alot of effort, so maybe, just let me know what platforms you would like support for and I’ll have a look.
