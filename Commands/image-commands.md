# Image Commands

## Introduction
Image commands are a set of commands that show a random image when a user types them. These images are picked at random from a list that is curated by the donators of Skuddbot.

## Puppies
To request a puppy image, a user uses one of the following commands:
- `!puppy`
- `!emergencypuppy`
- `!wuff` 
- `!dogger` 
- `!doggo`
- `!dog`
- `!pupper` 
- `!riit` 
- `!rogged`
- `!woowoo`
- `!dogo`
- `!dogggo`
- `!doogo`
- `!dogoo`
- `!owo`
- `!doggerino`
- `!addit`
- `!doggy`
- `!defectius`

## Kitties
To request a kitty image, a user uses one of the following commands:
- `!kitty`
- `!cat`
- `!pussy`
- `!kitten`

## Requesting multiple images
A user may request multiple images at once by providing a number with the command. For example typing `!puppy 5`, would display 5 random puppy images. Typing `!cat 3`, will show 3 random kitty images.  
This number can range from 1 through 5, the limit of 5 is a Discord limit, Discord does not show more than 5 embeds per image.

Server owners can enable and disable this behaviour using the `ALLOW_MULTI_IMG` setting. For more information on that view the [Allowing multiple images in image commands](/Features/server-settings.md#allowing-multiple-images-in-image-commands) section, in the [Server Settings](/Features/server-settings.md) article.
