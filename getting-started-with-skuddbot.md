### Step 2: Invite Tim to your server. <a id="h.3mjnf71ys3jd"></a>

If you haven’t already done so that is.

### Step 3: Server Authorization. <a id="h.m8l63j3gaykf"></a>

Skuddbot needs to be authorized to be on your server… Only Tim can do that, once he has done that, you may proceed to invite Skuddbot with the link Tim will give you.

### Step 4: Give Skuddbot the Administrator permission. <a id="h.5557qyx4s4h5"></a>

This permission should not be revoked from Skuddbot. EVER.

### Step 5: Sit back and relax. <a id="h.72lrldblt1ft"></a>

Skuddbot will get your server ready for use. Don’t worry, it’s only reading some things, nothing will be changed!

### Step 6: Allow your server mods/admins to use the admin commands of Skuddbot. <a id="h.d9d9r7moqg19"></a>
